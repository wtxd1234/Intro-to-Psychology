   - a modern version of psychoanalysis
   - more focused on development of a sense of self and discovery of motivations behind a person’s behavior other than sexual motivations​
   - link between neurobiology and psychodynamic concepts should be explored further​

2. __Behavioral Perspective__
   - __B.F. Skinner__ developed theory of operant conditioning​操作性条件反射
     - explains how voluntary自愿 behavior is learned
     - introduces concept of reinforcement加强

3. __Humanistic Perspective__
   - __“Third force”__ in psychology; reaction to both __psychoanalytic theory and behaviorism__. ​

   - Early founders:​
     - __Abraham Maslow__
     - __Carl Rogers__
    
4. __Cognitive Perspective__
   - Focuses on __memory, intelligence, perception, thought processes, problem solving, language, and learning​__
   - One example is Piaget’s _Theory of Cognitive Development​_
   - Includes cognitive neuroscience: study of the __physical changes in the brain and nervous system during thinking__. ​

​5. __Sociocultural Perspective__
   - Focuses on the relationship between __social behavior and culture__, combining two areas of study:​
     - __Social Psychology__: study of groups, social roles, and rules of social actions and relationships​
